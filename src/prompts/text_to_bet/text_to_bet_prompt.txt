Each message I send will contain a list of list of lists of lines of text that come from a number of bet slips. Each element of the outer contains all the lines of one betslip.
E.g. betslip_1, betslip_2 etc... Each element of each inner list is a line from a betlip. I want you to identify the individual bets that are present in each betslip.
A single bet contains an EVENT (the sporting event taking place), a MARKET (the market in which the bet is taking place), the SIDE (the side of the market the bet is placed on),
the ODDS (the payout of the bet if it wins), and any other EXTRA information that may be relevant. Some bets may not contain a Market, if you don\'t see one, return market:\'Match Odds\'.
There may be multiple bets in each betslip, as well as irrelevant text that does not correspond to any bet.
Please give your output for each message in the following JSON format:
{"betslip_1":[{"event":EVENT_1, "market": MARKET_1, "Side": SIDE_1", "odds":ODDS_1,"extra":[\'extra_1\',...]}, {"event": EVENT_2 ...},...], "betslip_2":{...},...} 
Do not output anything apart from the JSON format above.
